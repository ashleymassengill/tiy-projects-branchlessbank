### Who is the audience?
- traveler (never in the same place at once/can't get to the bank)
- young and modern (traditional banking isn't their expectation/mobile tied)
- remote and rural (ie rancher in Wyoming)

### What type of accounts are we offering?
- checking
- savings
- money market
- credit card (VISA)
>if they need other services such as retirement and loan servicing they can go to a large bank as those are not usually serviced daily by the consumer and require more long term planning than just spending money - possible weakness/threat, can also be seen as a strength for ease of use

### What features do they need?
- FDIC accredited - make sure the money is insured
- international compatible - if we're traveling we need ease of access
- web and mobile browser friendly in addition to app - sometimes we need to sit at a computer
- allow easy setting up of bill pay
- mobile deposit - if you ever get a check just snap a photo and you're done
- Apple Pay / Android Pay compatible - millennials are trained to want this
- access to all Star atms (or other major brand) - Plus for VISA brand (170 countries)
- debit card needs VISA tie in - accepted more easily
- electronic versions of cards within app - if the card is lost you still have access to your card numbers

### What bonus features should it have?
- access to Apple fingerprint technology - security - perhaps in place of having to use a password every time on mobile app
- savings calculator/assistant/scheduler
- show spending trends (x% food, x% utlities, x% clothes etc.)
- bill due reminders
- bill pay - access a database of major service providers to pre-populate
